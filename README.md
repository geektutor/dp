# How to use

The jQuery CropIt plugin was used for image upload. The inherent resize feature of the plugin was overriden due to certain design compromises.

JavaScript was used to place the uploaded image on top of a base frame, and export the resulting composite image to jpeg format. The base frame is a 1200 x 1200 picture. The alloted space for uploaded image is 800 x 800.

The naming style for the image is set on line 38, you can edit the `ECX_DP_` to suit your needs.

You can set the height and width of the uploaded image in the createDP function on line 92.
