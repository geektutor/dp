# Event DP

As an update, we will be adding a certificate generator to automatically generate certificates for students who successfully complete the program.

The idea is, we will have a csv file that will have names and emails in different columns.

The names will be added to the certificate frames (image frame) and emailed to the email on the email tab.

1. A function to read the csv and pick the names and emails. Names will be added to the frame while email will be used to mail them the certificates.

2. A function to add the names to the certificates.

3. A function to email the certificates generated to the emails and to the admin emails.
